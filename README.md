# Xapagy stories

This repository contains examples of comparatively complex stories to be fed to the Xapagy system. Normally, a subdirectory would contain:

* A _README.txt file which describes the domain and gives some examples of how to run the various stories
* A D-Domain.xapi file that contains commands to initialize the domain (usually concept, verb and word definitions)
* Some *.xapi files that represent the backup / warmup / synthetic autobiography of the agent
* A warmup.xapi file that loads the synthetic autobiography
* A StoryName.xapi file that contains the story itself
